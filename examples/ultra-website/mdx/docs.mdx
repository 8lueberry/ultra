# docs

> üìù These docs are a WIP of the alpha 2 release.

Welp, if you've made it here, you probably have a basic **Ultra** project
running. If not try this...

```bash
deno run -A https://deno.land/x/ultra@v2.0.0-alpha.5/init.ts
```

### [Extending Ultra](#extending-ultra)

**Ultra** gives you the control to use (or not use) many of the most popular
React libraries out there. You will probably
need to update your `importMap.json` `server.tsx` and `client.tsx`

We've prepared the following examples for you:

#### [Routing](#routing)

- Wouter [(with-wouter)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-wouter)
- React Router [(with-react-router)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-react-router)

#### [Data Fetching](#data-fetching)

- React Query [(with-react-query)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-react-query)

#### [CSS](#css)

- Emotion [(with-emotion)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-emotion)
- Stitches [(with-stitches)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-stitches)
- Twind [(with-twind)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-tailwind)

<small>or just use plain old CSS, it's _way_ underrated.</small>

#### [Head](#head)

- React Helmet Async [(with-react-helmet-async)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-react-helmet-async)

#### [API Routes](#api-routes)

- Hono [(with-api-routes)](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/main/examples/with-api-routes)

<small>If there is an existing library that you want to use, there is a good chance you
can create a custom integration. Use some of the examples above as a guide --
open a PR if you are keen.</small>
