**Ultra** is a web framework that leans hard into your browser's native
features. Embrace the future of **ES Modules**, **Import Maps**, and **Web
Streams**. All while supporting some of the non-standards that many normal
people love for some reason (**JSX** and **TypeScript**).

It's driven by the following hot-takes:

- **ESM** is non-negotiable in {currentYear}
- **SSR** is non-negotiable in {currentYear}
- Bundling is an **anti-pattern** in {currentYear}
- **Data can be requested anywhere, and is accessible on the server, always**
- **Lazy routing with dynamic imports** trumps FS routing
- **Less magic** in tooling and frameworks is a good thing
- **Simplify** your workflow and tech stack at all costs - life is too short
- **Streams** are neat

### ðŸ™Œ next

We are working towards the next milestone.
[v1.0.0](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/milestone/2) ðŸ—¿

### ðŸš§ v0.8.0

Lots of changes in v0.8.0!

- Vendored dependencies! We have a script that can take your CDN deps and make
  them local. (LINK 2 DOCS)
- API routes! (Thanks @Industrial) (LINK 2 DOCS)
- Removal of `makefile` in favour of
  [deno task](https://deno.com/blog/v1.20#new-subcommand-deno-task)
- Websocket refresh in dev mode. Ultra will restart on local changes.
- Fully support for
  [react@rc](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/react-18/text/0000-react-18.md):
  There were some updates to how streams are handled in the latest `rc`.
- Tighter integration with
  [Deno config file](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/configuration_file).
  Specifiying your `importMap` in `deno.json` is **required**

Because of these new features. Please ensure you are using at least Deno v1.20.3

### âœ¨ Wishlist

As we await the official release of React 18, here some things we are interested
in for the future of JS and/or Ultra:

- Better
  [Deno support in Vercel](https://github.com/vercel-community/deno/issues/95)
- React 18 [native ESM exports](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11503)
- [Native import maps](https://caniuse.com/import-maps): Browser support for
  import maps is still a bit sketchy. Instead of using import map polyfills,
  Ultra inlines your imports directly into the served ES modules.
- [Dynamic import](https://github.com/denoland/deploy_feedback/issues/1) support
  on Deno Deploy
- [Native CSS modules](https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-the-native-ones/)

**Thank you for going on this journey with us.**
