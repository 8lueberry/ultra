  <h1>Ultra</h1>
  <strong>Deno + React: No build, no bundle, all streaming</strong>
  <br /><br />

[![GitHub Workflow Status][actions-badge]][actions]

</div>

**Ultra** is a web framework that leans hard into your browser's native
features. Embrace the future of **ES Modules**, **Import Maps**, and **Web
Streams**. All while supporting some of the non-standards that many normal
people love for some reason (**JSX** and **TypeScript**).

It's driven by the following hot-takes:

- **ESM** is non-negotiable in {currentYear}
- **SSR** is non-negotiable in {currentYear}
- Bundling is an **anti-pattern** in {currentYear}
- **Data can be requested anywhere, and is accessible on the server, always**
- **Lazy routing with dynamic imports** trumps FS routing
- **Less magic** in tooling and frameworks is a good thing
- **Simplify** your workflow and tech stack at all costs - life is too short
- **Streams** are neat

**Warning:** The following is built around the _alpha_ version of
[React 18](https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html).
Mileage may vary.

Here are some neat demos:

### üë©‚ÄçüöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄ React 18: Suspense SSR

[Demo (taken from React's release announcement)](https://react18.ultrajs.dev)

### üî•üî• React Three Fiber

[Threejs, react, no build, no bundle](https://threejs.ultrajs.dev/)

### Quick start

The most minimal setup of **Ultra** can be found at
[/examples/boilerplate](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/master/examples/boilerplate).
There are more
[/examples](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/tree/master/examples)

<details><summary>HOW IT WORKS</summary>

<br/>

Everything is ES Modules. Server side rendering is default. Have the quickest
TTFB by using the React streaming server renderer.

```bash
# HTTP/2 200

* Received 381 B chunk
* Received 8 B chunk
* Received 6 B chunk
* Received 6 B chunk
* Received 1 B chunk
* Received 5 B chunk
* Received 2 B chunk
* Received 7 B chunk
```

[Import Maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) are used to manage 3rd party
dependencies. No bundling, building or complex package managers needed.

```js
{
  "imports": {
    "react": "https://esm.sh/react@alpha",
    "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@alpha"
  }
}
```

**Under the hood:** We use [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) +
[SWC](https://swc.rs) to transpile jsx/tsx in realtime. Your single ES modules
stay single ES modules, but as minified vanilla js, with your import maps
inlined.

**Note:** In development, modules are transpiled every request. In production,
transpiled modules are stored in an LRU cache. üëç

<details><summary>LAZY ROUTING</summary>

<br/>

Stop poking around at your filesystem. Routing can be defined anywhere in your
app, and dynamic imports will ensure only relevant route files are downloaded at
any given time.

Powered by [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter). Ah, what a breath of
fresh air...

```js
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Route } from "wouter";

const Home = lazy(() => import("./home.jsx"));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
      <Route path="/">
        <Home />
      </Route>
    </Suspense>
  );
};
```

<details><summary>SUSPENSE DATA FETCHING</summary>

<br/>

[SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr) lets us fetch data anywhere in our
components, works with Suspense everywhere.

**UPDATE v0.2**: now uses SWR v.1.0.0. This allows building of a cache server
side, and repopulating on client side. Please see example
[here](https://github.com/exhibitionist-digital/ultra/blob/master/examples/ultra-website/src/app.jsx#L5).

```js
import { SWRConfig } from "swr";
import ultraCache from "ultra/cache";

// Pass any SWR options your app needs here.
// ultraCache is used to populate your cache server side.
// This cache will be used when hydating app client side.
const options = (cache) => ({
  provider: () => ultraCache(cache), // required
  suspense: true, // required
  revalidateIfStale: false,
  revalidateOnMount: false,
});

const Ultra = ({ cache }) => {
  return (
    <SWRConfig value={options(cache)}>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </SWRConfig>
  );
};
```
